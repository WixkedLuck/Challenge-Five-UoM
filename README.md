# Work-Day-Scheduler 
Challenge 5 for UoM
For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a work day scheduler that uses JavaScript api's to achieve some of the websites functionality. Creating a basic to-do calander will help me keep track of my day-to-day activities. The starter code uses moment.js to work with date and time. 

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with third party api's such as jquery and moment.js. By creating a scheduler this helps me understand more about the DOM as well as event handling.  
 
- I built this project to further develope my skills and understand the basic fundimentals of api's. Creating this scheduler has helped me further my understanding of javasript, jQuery, and now moment.js. 

- This project resolves around having an interactive scheduler that allows a user to update their daily planner. When a user views the page they are presented with todays date and time followed by a 9-5 sceduler. Depending on the time the "blocks" will be color coded to indicate if it is in the past, present or future. A user can then select any time block and update the events sceduled for that specific time (this is saved to local storage). 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on third-party api's  and completion of an online scheduler that keeps local storage elements for the day.
